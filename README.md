# jirest

*jirest* is a command line tool to use Jira REST API easily and interactively from command line.

## Installation

On macOS,

1. Install [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco) and the dependencies.

    ```
    $ ./bin/setup
    ```

2.  Run the following command to setup your Jira Cloud Base URL, username (email address) and [API token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html).

    ```
    $ bundle exec exe/jirest init
    ```

Also, if you use [docker](https://www.docker.com/), you don't need to install specific software and run the command on docker container.

1. Create *jirest* data directory under your `$HOME`.

    ```
    $ mkdir $HOME/.jirest
    ```

    ```
    $ docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.jirest:/root/jirest/data okamotoyuki/jirest
    ```
    
    We recommend you to add the following line to your `.bashrc`.
    
    ```
    alias jirest='docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.jirest:/root/jirest/data okamotoyuki/jirest'
