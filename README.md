# jirest

*jirest* is a command line tool to use Jira REST API easily and interactively.

## Installation

*jirest* is provided as [docker image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#images-and-containers) so you don't need to install any dependencies on your local machine.

1. Create *jirest* data directory under your `$HOME`.

    ```
    $ mkdir $HOME/.jirest
    ```
2. Now, you can use *jirest* with the following command.

    ```
    $ docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.jirest:/root/jirest/data okamotoyuki/jirest
    ```
    
    We recommend you to add the following line to your `.bashrc`.
    
    ```
    alias jirest='docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.jirest:/root/jirest/data okamotoyuki/jirest'
    ```
3. Run `jirest init` command to setup your Jira Cloud Base URL, username (email address) and [API token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html).
